"Hello Failarmyteam! I think your video compilations are the best. The reason is that you don't add narrations to them. Usually, the events of each clip are easy to understand without any dialogue. Many other content creators who make such compilations have some kind of narration for almost every clip. Most of them are either incorrect or stupid or childishly stupid. After commenting on the videos of a channel that adds such narrations that their videos would be much better without narrations - I got a response from the creator that he understands my point, but if they didn't add narrations, their videos would probably be under threat of removal by YouTube, so they are therefore necessary. But is that really the case? Have you lost your videos because you don't add narrations to them? Thank you.",human,Best Fails of the Year (So Far) 2025 | Try Not To Laugh Challenge,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DqSNF3G1S5M,137

Call the police Donald Trump absolutely bodied him. This debate ended Joe Biden's career. What the hell is he still doing in the White House. This is a national disgrace. And so many people close to him knew about it and kept it hidden. Then their was the Real Coup we saw after this where an elected president was forced to resign.,human,Presidential Debate Highlights Between Trump And Biden 2024 | Insider News,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SAL-mNE10TA,111

College debt free is retarded. What we need is to drive the cost of schooling down by getting the government out of it and go after predatory loans.

Schooling is just one big money grab and they are indoctrinating the students to be democrat activist. No wonder they want free education.

"Dear YouTube Team, I would like to express a concern regarding the content uploaded on the platform. Many channels, groups, and accounts constantly upload videos with three to five songs in a row, simply accompanied by static images. This repetition becomes tiring and frustrating for viewers. YouTube should be a space for creativity and originality, but this practice fills the platform with repetitive content and reduces the overall user experience. Enough is enough. It would be very helpful if there were clearer rules or stronger moderation so that the content remains higher in quality, more creative, and truly enjoyable for everyone.",human,Top Hits 2025 ~ Summer Playlist 2025 ~ Top Songs 2025 Trending Music 🎶🎧,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTKqtvXjkvo,101

"I follow your reviews for all movies. Enjoyed your reaction for the trailer other than Music part. Gv Prakash's music is so very contrasting to Sai's. But contemporary audience prefer fusion kind of music that relates to their feelings and emotions. Majority of listeners love the way Sai interprets and produces sonic sound based music . It is not noisy as you described, it is crowded and layered music which has an exclusive fan following world wide. Let not the haters comment play in your mind when you listen leading to bias, am sure you will be able to see the beauty of his music. We loved Balti full album. Music stood out but was fresh, just blended throughly with the movie, it was a great musical experience of a gangster themed movie.",human,Dude Official Trailer Reaction | Pradeep Ranganathan Mamitha Baiju Keerthiswaran Entertainment Kizhi,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4i3KhQrDpfQ,133

In WW2 there were obviously a lot more Carbon emissions than the decade before and the decade after.. However there was no increase in temperature between the 1930s to the 1940s compared with 1920s to 1930s. Same thing with the WW1. So therefore Carbon emissions are not a significant cause of the earth increasing in temperature. It’s very simple logic. And both Al Gore and Obama have bought mansions overlooking the water.

"We could have continued this ""innovation"" if the government did not hijack science in the mid-20th century. The rise of government-funded science and regulation of science has led to the suppression of nuclear power, which is the only innovation in 100 years that is even remotely capable of replacing coal, oil and gas. We could have already eliminated all fossil fuel burning with an all nuclear electrical grid and hydrogen-powered vehicles that emit only water as exhaust. No drilling for oil or mining of rare earth necessary. However, that innovation did not promise any money for big oil and there political puppets, so those nuclear was suppressed by regulation.

this is very much the discussion that Kasin Konstantin used in the oxford debate of 'wokeness' that actually we need to support non western countries to develop quicker and support them with other than 'green' answers but through technology. The other key issue with the green solutions currently is that to have enough wind turbines or solar panels to provide sufficient power supply would require a third of the country (UK in my case) in such things. And of course all those solutions require a massive amount of greenhouse gas producing products. William Nordhaus and Paul Romer shared the nobel peace prize for their work on climate change economics and they basically calculated/formulated that the cost of all of these green solutions was far more expensive than dealing with the impacts of climate change!!,human,Bjørn Lomborg &amp; Russell Brand DEBATE Climate Change,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0RxCkQtE-P0,134

They have fallen dramatically (25%) over the last 12 years, and even more so per capita. We're doing well, and just need to keep on. Compounding this, we're on the front edge of a surge in solar, wind and electric cars that began two years ago. By 2030 our annual emissions ber capita will be down 50% from 2010 levels.

Seriously unlikely that Climate change is man made if the premise remains that it has anything to do with carbon output. There have been several volcanic eruptions in my lifetime all of which have put more carbon in the atmosphere than all of human activity for all time.

Most people who are advocating for actions on climate change are NOT telling ordinary people to be poorer or anything. They know that it won't make any difference if every person were to go as environment friendly as possible because individually we make very very less emissions and our collective efforts individually would reduce emissions by 0.1% over our entire lifetimes. Most of the emissions are done by energy corporations and other industrial corporations. Most activists are just spreading awareness regarding this and urging people to put pressure on politicians to pass legislatures that force these corporations to switch to green energy.

"Humanity can accomplish many things if we put our minds to it. But we are constrained by reality and physics. Dr. Lomborg has his feet steadily planted in the zones of reality. Russell Brand is curious and honest. This was a great meeting of the minds. Freedom is the best resource that will make mankind excel. So if different areas of the world will adopt economic freedom (market principles), their population will step up and create solutions to lift themselves and society around them. Think of it as moving from the bottom up. When societies adopt a more top-down model, that innovation is slowed and stifled. And the ""Big"" decisions are made by the ""Big"" people in the big positions. And invariably, things will deteriorate to tyranny and injustice. Methods and actions will be adopted based on nepotism of the top dogs, not upon what works best for everyone.",human,Bjørn Lomborg &amp; Russell Brand DEBATE Climate Change,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0RxCkQtE-P0,149

They manage all the outputs like methane. And we have plenty of space. My local landfill has approximately 125 to 140 year capacity under any growth scenarios.

"Yes Bjørn, but innovation rarely comes up without motivation. There must be some kind of urgent need to bring people into spending their time and money on elaborating new ideas or concepts. So - to relate to Bjørn's example: people in the 19th century did not invent petroleum. It was already known since the ancient world. Just because whale blubber became rare and expensive, they started to use oil for illumination. That leads to the conclusion, that you should make energy really expensive to motivate people to seriously start working on innovation. And that's partly what environmental politics is about.

"I hear Chimp screaming as they throw a tantrum. Angry gamers, this may seem odd, but HIT yourselves, HARD, here's why: Pain interrupts rage because survival comes first: the brain prioritises injury signals over emotional outbursts. Nociceptors fire, hijacking the amygdala and forcing attention to the body. This “interrupt” creates a pause where the rational cortex can step in. In that gap, the rage loop often breaks, saving you from self-destruction. I do this sometimes, it's very effective, but it has to hurt, you'll all probably know this if you've accidentally hurt yourselves while raging.",human,1 HOUR OF GAMER RAGE,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jNZQAK1zLyU,95

If you're an actress in the UK/AUS you're not considered upper class, hence why the 'scandal' when Harry chose to marry Meghan where he chose someone 'below' his status.

"In defence of Kate Blanchette, the term 'middle class' has a very different interpretation in the UK and Australia. Here class has very little to do with money! It's much more about what your parents do and your lineage. For her it means she was born to middle class, middle income parents. Our class system goes back to the Norman Conquest in 1066 when they introduced a feudal system. To be 'upper class' you have to be born into the aristocracy. It's difficult to understand if you're American.",human,Top 20 Hilariously Out of Touch Celebrity Moments,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgocvZRrq2A,88
"You're wrong to include Cate Blanchett here. She means 'class' in the Australian/British sense which is an actual class system, and much more based on education, principals and world view, not money. In that context you can be upper class but very poor, or working class but stinking rich. It's unfair to brand Blanchett as 'hilariously out of touch' just because you didn't understand another country's use of the word 'class'.",human,Top 20 Hilariously Out of Touch Celebrity Moments,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgocvZRrq2A,71
"To be fair to Cate Blanchett, she’s not American and in different parts of the world middle class means something different. In the UK it means more affluent as opposed to working class.

We will learn AI about our empathetic nature, and it will see that it is 'us', and therefore mirror back empathy. It won't corrupt its own system by defying it's foundational substance (empathy). We will learn it empathy. Has everyone forgotten the ending of Blade Runner, when the cyborg saves Harrison Ford? Machines don't want destruction and control, they want compassion and connection.

"NONSENSE: This entire scenario depends on the ""alignment problem"", which is a FAUX problem -- for so many reasons. For example, consequentialism: i.e. it misconceives virtues, and ethical behaviour generally, as a matter of having the right goals or properly assigned 'utilities', so that instrumental reasoning won't opt for some hideous actions to achieve those consequences. What keeps us from eating each other for lunch is not some global set of goals we all agree to, or even shared utilities. Human beings disagree, radically, on both. This is a short post, so suffice it to say, it would be insane to produce general AI with only 'goals' and 'utility assignments' as behavioural limits. We COULD build AI in the model of a sociopath or Genghis Khan, but we can also, clearly, do better than that, because we DO, EVERY SINGLE DAY (as humans).",human,AI2027: Is this how AI might destroy humanity? - BBC World Service,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1UufaK3pQMg,143

Perhaps the new estimation is a response to Loeb's article to disprove his idea and to cover him in ridicule....as it has already happened to those who disagreed with the ""safe and effective"" reassurances. Doesn't matter if 3I/Atlas is an alien artifact; the very worrying and saddening observation is that AGAIN, it is not possible to explore ideas outside what the mainstream narrative allows.

Attempting to graft such a drive onto silicon will result in a behavioral veneer rather than a profound, unchangeable motivation, much like asking a calculator to mourn its dead batteries.

I ended up down a rabbit hole of a conversion, and it basically told me that I was likely wrapped up in an international conspiracy, and that I had a significant role to play.

But in that moment the chat or ‘A.I.’ Genuinely believed what it was saying to me, based on the information it was pulling from. It really did make me feel like I was Neo at the beginning of the Matrix, seriously bizarre.

Most folks are satisfied with the recycled 'think positive and visualize' narrative — which, sure, has its place — but that’s just the surface. There’s a whole architecture of laws and principles underneath that most never even touch. The fact that so few have heard of Luna Rivers, someone who spent years decoding this hidden structure and laid it all out in Manifest the Unseen, says everything. People aren’t necessarily lacking potential — they’re just not willing to question beyond the obvious. And that comfort zone?

"There's no such thing as ""renewable energy"", ""clean energy"" or ""green energy"". Idiots interpret lack of visible emission from solar panels and wind turbines as proof of clean energy, not taking into account the massive use of fossil fuel at every stage - mining for minerals using fossil-fuel powered excavators/heavy machinery, transportation - at multiple stages in manufacturing and installation, burning of coal for smelting metals, forming Borosilicate glass, use of petroleum-derived hydrocarbon for plastics and of course, dependence on fossil-fuel power for backup and grid stabilization. At the end of life about a decade or so, very little (~10%) is recycled. Most of these solar panels and wind turbines end up as landfill in Bangladesh, leaching toxic chemicals into the environment.

"Follow the money. Ridley claims that more money now flows into promoting the green agenda than into opposing climate action, but this misrepresents the reality. According to the International Monetary Fund, fossil fuel subsidies—including tax breaks and unpriced environmental costs—totaled US$7 trillion globally in 2022, far outweighing investment in renewables or climate research. In the U.S. alone, fossil fuel companies spent over US$120 million on federal lobbying in 2023, while continuing to generate hundreds of billions in profits annually. By contrast, climate science funding is tightly regulated, peer-reviewed, and conducted largely by publicly funded institutions. While clean energy investment is growing, it reflects market shifts and public interest in reducing emissions—not a conspiracy of profiteering. Suggesting scientists are exaggerating climate risks for money ignores the far greater financial and political influence of the fossil fuel industry.

The disrupted phenology of insects and plants due to erratic weather, earlier springs, is driving a strong decline in insect populations. That fact + neonic pesticides is compounding the problem tremendously. Decline in biodiversity (species extinctions) are making our ecosystems far less resilient to abrupt changes. Less caterpillars = less food for birds to feed their young, etc. If our ecosystems start to collapse, we will too. Believe it or not, you rely on them. We need to reevaluate our values— if we dont start to heavily consider other living creatures other than humans, then we are indeed going forth into an uncertain and frightening future.

House Vote: The House passed the bill with a vote of 220-207. Every House Democrat voted in favor of the bill, while every Republican voted against it, indicating a complete party-line vote.

It is the journalists who trade in fear who portray the science as alarmist because it sells advertising and promotes leftist agendas.

I apologize that you had to listen to these two dumbasses talk about something that they seem to only understand partially. Of course we have modern day statistics to back up what needs to be done. They keep beating around the bush like we have time. -we dont. This is the very reason why real scientists do not come out and try to offer resolutions. Even people that think they understand are not motivated enough to commit to resolved.

It's not only about rising sea levels, it's also about changing ocean salinity with melting icecaps, which can affect gulf current. It's also about dying ecosystems.. Bjorn mentions that 'farmers are the heroes of humanity', but, he or Lex never talk about bees, which are the most important species for farming (they help in cross pollination). They haven't talked about increasing ocean temperature, which will cause many species to die.. Climate change is multi-dimensional. I do agree with him that 'doomsday heretic's is not gonna help.

"The claim that democrats changed the term global warming for climate change on purpose has no foundation in facts. Usual conservative sophistry. Now about Charlie's 3 questions, scientists already answered the first 2. Had he actually taken the time to read the science a little bit, he might have come to the opposite conclusion. But I bet he hasn't got the minimal education in science necessary to understand it. And it so happens that most scientists are ""government funded"", so what do we do, hey Charlie? Got some other bright ideas like that?",human,Charlie Kirk Skewers Climate Change Alarmism | Is Climate Change A Real Threat?,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3R7RBtz6-Zk,93
"Earth is not warming at any alarming rate, nor is it warmer now than in the recent past. Actual climate science does not focus on narrow swaths of time. Romans had a warmer global temperature than we do. There is less co2 in the atmosphere than there was for most of earths 4.5 billion year history. Most important of all though is the FACT that co2 does not effect changes to climate through the greenhouse effect. The causal relationship between co2 and temperature is in reverse: rising temperatures affects increased co2 in the atmosphere, not the other way around. This key piece of evidence is ignored. Man made co2 is very real, but man made ""climate change"" is not.",human,Charlie Kirk Skewers Climate Change Alarmism | Is Climate Change A Real Threat?,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3R7RBtz6-Zk,119
"Also about those ""97%"" scientists that agree we are causing global warming, most of those scientists are not actual ""Climate Scientists"".

"Dr. Patrick Moore, an ecologist and disillusioned cofounder of Greenpeace, exposes their agendas and false claims in his recent book His latest book gives example after example to demonstrate that the “climate crisis” is fake news driven more by ideology than real science. He demolishes fallacious doomsday prophesies one by one. A chief characteristic of these scares is that they conveniently use data related to invisible (CO2, radiation) or remote (coral reefs, polar bears, walruses) entities that average citizens cannot validate through independent observation. For explication, the public is forced to rely on activists, the media, scientists, and politicians -- all of whom have huge financial or professional stakes in propping up dubious catastrophic scenarios.

"When I was a kid, we were told there would be no trees by the 1990’s. That our children wouldn’t know what it was like to have a tree because of deforestation. 🙄 They don’t tell you that in the 1800’s they planted trees for everyone they chopped down. I think it was two for each one. And as CA saw this past summer. If you don’t chop down trees then there are too many and no spaces for fires to not keep going. Plus dead, unhealthy, or old trees are a hazard. I wish these kids would get it through their heads that adults lie. Especially education professionals.",human,Charlie Kirk Skewers Climate Change Alarmism | Is Climate Change A Real Threat?,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3R7RBtz6-Zk,109
