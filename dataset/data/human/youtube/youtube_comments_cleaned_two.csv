"🤚🤎💛What would you do if you saw a blind man heading towards an abyss with fire below? You'd tell that blind man to change direction so he wouldn't fall down there, wouldn't you? If you live a life of sin, lust, don't serve God, don't walk in his commandments, you're this blind man and I'm the one warning you to change direction so you don't fall into the abyss. God does not force anyone to serve him, however when we do not serve God, we are automatically serving the evil one. Many will say: But I am honest, I do not steal, I am fair, etc. No one can pay their own price, only Jesus was able to pay the high price for all of us, so that everyone who believes in him will not perish in the abyss, but have eternal life with God.

this is the exact way I discovered works best for dicing onions. A lot of chefs say to do the vertical cuts first... nope... do it the way he shows in this video - horizontal cuts (not quite to the root) then vertical (not quite to the root) then dice. The root holds it all together the whole time - which is how all chefs suggest - but making the horizontal cut first (not vertical) makes it easiest regarding the layers sliding around.

It's a very dense progressive city and you can feel swept up in the ""progress at all costs"" mentality; everything is magnified more than other sparse cities that are not so urban. It's not hard seeing your friends travel all the time and seem to have endless money/career progression while you progress more slowly - this profoundly impacts self-worth. But for those who don't make comparisons, hold their head high and know they are on thier own path, then you can stay more happy in Singapore or anywhere in the world for that matter. I've had to do my own work on my internal ""self-worth quotient"" while being here because I really felt it.",human,How Happy Are Singaporeans Really in 2025? | Street Interview,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQhIPchN-AQ,139

Been to Singapore few times and the main reason i like it there is the sense of security i find there. That place is good for n number of days for vacation but if anyone wants to stay they better be an introvert coz i feel it doesn't have the vibe of an extrovert.

It got me thinking about where this technology could go next. Do you see any major innovations or breakthroughs on the horizon in this space that might change the game in the next 5–10 years?

"AI adoption in business brings profound social and economic impacts that extend far beyond simple automation. On the opportunity side, AI can dramatically improve efficiency by streamlining repetitive tasks, optimizing decision-making, and enabling predictive insights that save time and resources. It also opens doors to entirely new business models, such as personalized services at scale, AI-driven product innovation, and enhanced customer engagement. However, the challenges are equally significant. Job displacement and the need for large-scale workforce reskilling present pressing social concerns, while data privacy, bias, and regulatory uncertainty raise ethical and economic risks. Balancing innovation with responsibility is essential. Businesses that embrace AI thoughtfully can gain competitive advantage, but sustainable adoption requires integrating human oversight, transparency, and inclusive strategies that benefit society broadly.",human,Coolest New Technologies of 2025,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T-F-vVNVQ50,123

I'm not saying a man and woman can't have a platonic relationship but I guarantee 9/10 of those either the woman or man (mostly the guy) will have feelings for the other. The 1/10 is either the dude really doesn't have feelings or is gay. People can say this is bullshit but thats usually coming from a clueless woman who thinks her best guy friend for a decade is not in love with her when he clearly is. Or some douche who is just waiting for his opportunity to hear about her fight and he's trying to get laid.,human,Relationship Dilemmas That Make You Think | Reading Reddit Stories,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OuMRu-JhbVw,113

I don’t think there is an issue with expecting your partner to contribute to the costs of buying a house but this sort of stuff should be decided before a place is chosen. If the expectation is 50/50 then you should get a place the person on the lower income can afford to go 50/50 on. You can’t go over their budget and expect them to cover half. If you want a nicer place than that you need to work out a percentage based on the two incomes. If there is an expectation to go 50/50 paying off a mortgage then I think both having ownership of the house is fair. Maybe if you don’t want to share ownership the lower income person can pay for food and utilities.,human,Relationship Dilemmas That Make You Think | Reading Reddit Stories,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OuMRu-JhbVw,129
I feel like with the story at maybe if they could come up with some sort or agreement of paying just a little bit towards the house with putting the rest of it into a savings for her to eventually put in money towards to house so that she’s stable enough with her debt before putting money into her girlfriends house could help clear it up a tiny bit more and build a little bit more trust?

"For the story about the partner having to pay rent doesn't sound complicated to me. OP's girlfriend agreed to pay the ""rent"" before they bought the house. She should honor it. I also don't really see it as ""rent"" rather her contribution to paying the mortgage for the house they bought together. The only reason it would be called rent is because her name isn't on the deed to the house. Which is the only reason she feels she can get away with not paying it. I think OP should break up with her girlfriend. Hiding debt until you go to buy a house together feels like a deal breaker. It also feels like her girlfriend is taking advantage of OP's hard work. The only reason the house isn't in both of their names is because her girlfriend's bad credit and debt could cause them to not get the house.",human,Relationship Dilemmas That Make You Think | Reading Reddit Stories,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OuMRu-JhbVw,150

It was... the most INTERESTING time. I let him move in, like, a week later. As a roommate. Not a boyfriend. He had his own room and everything.

By 40, it's much harder. There's also plenty of evidence to suggest that doing it with someone, then marrying someone different, weakens the bond.

If my dad falls asleep first, my mom can't sleep because the snoring keeps her awake. If my mom sleeps first, my dad becomes unable to sleep because her movements rouse him out of sleep.

It took a lot of work and talking and therapy, but we got to the point of being much more like an H, both carrying the table but standing on our own, too.

Granted, being the “picky eaters are my pet peeve” person is also rude and obnoxious-it’s the same trait, just reversed-and I do get a faint whiff of that potential from the OP, but dude beat her to the punch by being an absolute ass about making his food hangups the focus of any interaction.",human,Dating Dos And Don&#39;ts | Reading Reddit Stories,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K56b0DWrnUE,114

Out the 4 conjuring movies I have this at 2. There’s something about this movie that pulled on my heart strings more so I felt more in tune with all the characters. I also just think they did a great job building tension for each scene. I wish we had a revel for the monster controlling the entities but I guess they are saving that for a spin-off.

"Just fyi as an ex (Irish) Catholic, communion is where you are allowed to finally 'take' the body of Christ. It strengthens the believers and unites them with God through the symbolic consumption of Jesus' body, aka Holy Bread. Confirmation is the second sacrament where the individual receives the Holy Spirit and is a public declaration of faith. The dress worn by the young girl upon receiving her confirmation is incorrect; this dress is used for communion only. It's such a small detail and while I am no lover of the Catholic Church, the lack of research on this detail signalled to me what a disappointment this movie would become.

Now, instead of the left and media admitting they lied to us, they simply double down and defend lawlessness above law enforcement.

But AI cant do complex or subtle reasoning as it lacks a world model and common knowledge and will never get it.

"Boosting productivity has always been something I strive for, but no matter how many systems I tried, it never really stuck. Then I came across the idea that having an accountability partner could change the game, especially when I kept slipping on my own.

So far, it feels like the extra push I’ve been needing. I’m excited to see where this leads.",human,7 Free AI Productivity Tools I Use Every Day,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-WG3EkxEzg,91

"My biggest concern about ai tools is data protection, trusting such a tool by opening up and sharing personal private facts and information about yourself is just plan crazy. we should all know the risks that this is part of personal data mining, and will be for sure stored in the cloud, and cross referenced to all your other stored information... Scary!! Imagine sharing online your CV, this will probably including your full name, phone number, address, job history, about yourself, a photo .. or asking an innocent question about medical problems... Imagine this been used at sometime in future against you, if your data is sold on, shared or stolen. It might not even be a human using this data, it could be AI itself using it for it's advantage at your expense 😮",human,99% of Beginners Don&#39;t Know the Basics of AI,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nVyD6THcvDQ,135

"Never listen to this fool Goggins, I over trained like he suggested and all I got was long rest periods, unable to train or do much. Don't push through the pain, think about the consequence, theres a reason why pro athletes are most terrified of getting injured. For perspective, an injury will take months for you to recover but you only improved 1% at best, then lost 20-30% of ALL your progress at minimum so it's literally like taking 1 step forward and falling down a cliff. If you took your time instead, listened to your body and had a sensible training routine rather than listening to this fool, you would of improved so much more and kept the momentum going. It's so easy to overtrain, push too hard, get injured then can't do shit, whats hard is holding back and sticking to your training schedule like a robot.",human,The Most Motivating 6 Minutes of Your Life | David Goggins,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zy5c2k3W458,149

It is natural to be lazy as I told my own subscribers. But is it actually evil? It is--and not in a religious sense but a holistic sense. No matter what you believe to be a higher power or none at all we all know that laziness hurts you. It takes away from your physical health which deteriorates your mental health. Which in turn makes you want to not advance yourself. And years go by and suddenly you realize you are in a listless life. The midlife crisis usually avoids those who are in a state of physical healthy lifestyle and continuous progression. For the greatest evil is knowing that you aren't alive but merely existing.

However, from my experience, people who yell at you make you feel insignifiant. They put you down instead of rising you up.

"Sal is wrong. Physically alcohol is worse. Mentally marijuana is worse. It’s plain and simple. I smoked since 14 and am 28 now. Can’t smoke anymore, it ruined a lot of shit in my life.

I don’t think Sal is making his point very well 🤣 no one is homeless because they’re addicted to weed. Weed doesn’t literally KILL you like alcohol does.

"For the first one humans do technically have the biggest brain to body ratio. And that is partly why we’re so smart. Amongst mammals, brain to body ratio is suggested to heavily correlate with intelligence. Only a few creatures have a smaller brain to body ratio. Like ants, small avians, and the elephant fish. The lowest for a mammal is actually the tree shrew. But second place is tied between humans and mice. And well we’ve already kind of concluded that rats and mice are too smart for their own good. So the theory tracks. We are the largest creature with such a small brain to body ratio, and this is a result of us becoming omnivores, eating meat and becoming predatory.

After that I personally cant stand any episode featuring Eddie Bravo. Dude is annoying at best and down right retarded at worst. If I ever see him listed as the guest I just skip the episode. But I do agree Ari is an aquired taste. He was alot less annoying a couple of years ago but last few years he has gotten pretty bad.
