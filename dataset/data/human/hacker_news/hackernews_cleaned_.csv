Indeed, these choices are so arbitrary and lead to such a high degree of difference in the binary forms that the same compiler running on the same code will often generate different binary output.

The replacements were going to be 4000K not great for blue light. Luckily I was able to convince the city to source 3000K ballasts instead, which were just coming out on the market. They re definitely whiter than sodium bulbs but 3000K has very little blue light and should be fine for melatonin. The number of streetlights was doubled, but power consumption was still halved the LEDs paid for themselves. Finally, light pollution was reduced because the ballasts point down at a 45 degree angle. All of which is to say with a bit of thinking and or use of smart standards, it should be possible to use LEDs in streetlights to save energy, money, and reduce light pollution.",32908560,1663701810,2022-09-20 19:23:30,138

However, as you have pointed out, since it is also a market where people have few choices, there is no incentive for any new player to significantly lower the prices. Even if they easily could. Because they know that they will get the customers anyway. That seems to be the root cause of the excessive price problem. An existing oligopoly of rent-seeking companies. Or a cartel, if you like. I think that one of the ways to disturb this market and bring the prices down is for some honest company to join it and price their products fairly.

39062776,xyzzy123,I think it s easier to see if you jump up 1 level of abstraction from transistors to logic gates. Imagine an adder made up of logic gates. The gates aren t inherently synchronous - they don t have a clock input - signals appear at their inputs and some time later propagate to their outputs. To make the adder synchronous you need flip flops at the inputs outputs and a clock. If you squint a bit you can view most designs as blobs of async logic sandwiched between sync elements gated by the clock . We can see that a signal might have to go through a lot of gates transistors between flip-flops and so the gates and their underlying transistors will necessarily need to be able to switch faster than the clock.,39062515,1705706523,2024-01-19 23:22:03,134

Then, based on the deviation from 4.5 in each set, I nudged the random cutoff up or down. It seems to result in most evenly distributed randomness if you change the 0.5 to 0.36725 or so.

Now, make it a batch of asynchronous processors. Each chip you make will have a different performance - one will add some floats faster, another will fetch run faster but only if the second bit of the address is set , while a third one will shine on integer addition, but completely suck at subtraction due to a problem in a single transistor .

Dynamic memory is seductive for the task of indefinite scaling, but a practical system always encounters bottlenecks that aren t along the memory management axis, and in the meantime your code is much harder to verify. NB Historically, game engines have tended towards object pooling at runtime without any dynamic allocations. In that case there is a defined limit to what a scene will accommodate, and the object counts often simply reflect the other performance bottlenecks involved. GC is still nice, but mostly in the sense of stitching together the most dynamic elements of the system.

The reason for the one year cliff is to protect the company and its shareholders including the employees from a bad hire which gets a huge grant of stock or options but proves to be a mistake right away. One year doesn't at all strike me as right away. Even as few as 3 months seems a stretch, for a startup. A cliff vest allows the company to move the bad hire out of the company without any dilution.

People who have never built a successful business won't understand. As soon as you strongly feel it's time to sell, do it. Get out and build your next thing. Later you might regret it, that's natural, but better than having things decay on their own if you're not fully with it. My advice - yes, sell.",1651001,1283336849,2010-09-01 10:27:29,129

Even putting aside the issue that it can't handle cycles constantly writing to memory to modify reference counts can be a huge performance hit you often have to do it even when you are accessing objects in a read-only fashion . Also it requires extra memory on a per-object basis. Also it doesn't play nicely with concurrent threads. Also it's not cache friendly. I'd expect any halfway-decent modern GC implementation to be significantly more efficient than reference counting. About the only valid justification I can see nowadays for not using a GC is a hard-realtime latency requirement. Yep, GC pauses suck.

As an avid reader of nonfiction and fiction equally, the two cannot be read with the same eye to gain the most. If one were to continue with the consuming metaphor- it s very possible to eat fried rice with a shallow, metal spoon- but some authenticity is lost in the experience of eating even when it still reaches your mouth and your gullet just the same.",20231588,1561033267,2019-06-20 12:21:07,142

It also requires that expenditure to be significant enough that gaming the system is expensive. As a result most of of them scale as the effort inevitably get s easier thus ensuring that the energy required to validate a transaction will only ever be capable of growing not shrinking.

The 737 Max has a tendency in certain conditions high angle of attack to pitch up even when the pilot keeps applying a constant force.

However, the extensibility environment for some DBMSs is fraught with perils, causing developers to resort to unorthodox methods to achieve their goals. This paper studies and evaluates the design of DBMS extensibility. First, we provide a comprehensive taxonomy of the types of DBMS extensibility. We then examine the extensibility of six DBMSs PostgreSQL, MySQL, MariaDB, SQLite, Redis, and DuckDB. We present an automated extension analysis toolkit that collects static and dynamic information on how an extension integrates into the DBMS. Our evaluation of over 400 PostgreSQL extensions shows that 16.8 of them are incompatible with at least one other extension and can cause system failures. These results also show the correlation between these failures and factors related to extension complexity and implementation.

Is it possible to somehow sign GPS coordinates? Perhaps sync an internal clock at each mission's start, and check a time-based signature? If not, are there practical challenges to integrating the output of a drone's engine and calculating the path travelled, instead of naively believing satellite coordinates? Actually, wind must make that difficult. For a car, you can attach a magnet to each wheel and count the surges as it passes a sensor on each rotation, to give you an idea of where you are. Due to the external forces on a drone, you would probably want to measure forces with an accelerometer gyroscope, not engine output. What are the challenges involved in such?

In my case, I am extracting atomic environments from noisy rotated and permuted copies of an archetypal atomic environment, but I imagine the same technique applied to photography would produce stunning results. You would be surprised with the amount of noise for which you can still recover the true signal.

Asking the customer roughly when they expect to pick up their orders 2. Staging orders in refrigerated and non-refrigerated sections for quick final assembly at pick-up 3.

That it is not trivial for a single person on the Internet to receive payments without a third-party involved, in my mind, leads directly to an Internet that is based on ads and on monopolies You can t make a living posting stuff online on your own private website. Because since you cannot receive money, any value that you add online can never be translated into value offline. So you need to post on someone else s site, which then acts as a publisher, and has the economies of scale necessary to make taking payments viable.

43672192,ChrisSD,"I think the two basic synchronisation primitives are atomics and thread parking. Atomics allow you to share data between two or more concurrently running threads whereas parking allows you to control which threads are running concurrently. Whatever low-level primitives the OS provides such as futexes is more an implementation detail. I would tentatively make the claim that channels in the abstract are at heart an interface rather than a type of synchronisation per se. They can be implemented using Mutexes, pure atomics if each message is a single integer or any number of different ways. Of course, any specific implementation of a channel will have trade-offs.

The way it's worked traditionally is that can't quite tell which authors are going to be big sellers, so you take a chance on a bunch, and the more successful ones subsidize the less successful.

Furthermore, clinically relevant evidence demonstrates that placebo effects can have meaningful therapeutic effects, by virtue of magnitude and duration, in different patient populations.

21337313,btilly,"Quick explanation. Flipping a bit in classical computing is an irreversible operation, and so has to release heat. We also have to be in one state at a time. In quantum computing, we are only allowed reversible operations, but can be in a superposition of states. There is no heat released, no upper limit on how fast the operations can go, and no upper limit on parallelism. But the flip side is that you cannot peek at the operation, and error correction is not exactly easy. The only reversible operations bit is a huge restriction. For example it means that if statements are not allowed.",21337071,1571854810,2019-10-23 18:20:10,105

And he was found guilty of a criminal offence. Websites are a bit more of a grey area. Whose server is it? Who s paying for it? Who owns the domain?

Rust itself is not easy to learn, but once you overcome that, its thread-safety features are amazing, and can catch bugs that could otherwise be very difficult to track down. In Golang you re at risk of forgetting to use a mutex or atomic where necessary, or having some function mutate object you thought was immutable, and the race detector needs to catch such violations at run time, whereas Rust catches them at compile time. Rust has libraries for multi-threaded jobs like parallel iterators , while in Golang I see people making ad-hoc DIY versions of these with channels and goroutines, and the simple constructs don t always handle cases like cancellation or panics.",39380310,1707998387,2024-02-15 11:59:47,135

With WebXR you can bypass any app stores too or avoid side loading processes. The downside is you more constrained performance-wise with WebXR and have to keep that in mind during implementation.

That has changed such that people do not trust these groups to make these deals on their behalf because there have been bad outcomes.

Basically, the normal rules apply. If you want safe spreadsheets, you have to plan and verify. The reason this doesn t happen is because firstly, spreadsheets are very accessible. Every working large system evolves from a working small system, as John Gall observed. Excel et al make that evolution relatively easy. The second is that spreadsheets enable non-programmers to work with concrete concepts instead of the abstract ones that programming languages encourage. It s easy to visualise locations on a sheet when you are looking at the sheet. Finally, spreadsheets support calculation by propagation. They are an excellent declarative environment.

But this is absolutely correct, so the fact that the sentence leads to this correct conclusion doesn t make it silly. Genotype is just genes. The manifestations are all determined by the interaction of genes with the environment and the manifestations of observable traits together make up the phenotype. Some aspects of this are practically tightly controlled by genes because the environments which allow an organism to develop at all tend to also be ones in which the genes involved are expressed in certain ways, and some are less tightly controlled by genes, because there is more practical variation in interaction with the environment.

The crucial point here is that the advertisement is useful and relevant to the consumer, and so is not interpreted as an interruption or distraction. Moreover, these ads don t tend to carry malware because they re media produced by the media company in question, often hosted on the same domain. This is a model that presently works.

It's really just trying all possible edits, recording the cost and progress until the costs exceed the budget or you've reached the goal. To handle transposition, you need the state to remember the last character typed if it happens to match the next character, so the state space gets bigger. In your example for hello, from the start state you'll introduce a state for starting with e. This state encodes typed 'last char was e, matched nothing, cost 1'.

For me I just use wiki s Intelligence can be described as the ability to perceive or infer information and to retain it as knowledge to be applied to adaptive behaviors within an environment or context. Nothing in that definition disallows a system from being pure mechanism and also being intelligent. An mp3 player isn t intelligent because - unlike AI - it isn t taking in information to retain it as knowledge to be applied to adaptive behaviors within an environment or context. An mp3 player that learns my preferences over time and knows exactly when to say hi and how based on contextual cues is displaying intelligence.

One reason people don t care about consuming unhealthy seed oils is the simplicity of eating packaged foods - cheap and convenient. I try to almost 100 avoid packaged foods and this system of eating is a HUGE hassle and time sink. I will compromise and for example use a Falafel mix instead of grinding fava beans and chickpeas, but otherwise buy whole grains in bulk, fresh vegetables, meat, and fruit.

Further, and perhaps more importantly, by understanding each distribution, you have far greater knowledge about what the expected time will be, and where the delays are most probable and you can begin to start analyzing where those delays might be coming from in the interactions of all the parts of the system.

Taichi experimentally achieved on-chip 1000-category level classification testing at 91.89 accuracy in the 1623-category Omniglot dataset and high-fidelity artificial intelligence generated content with up to two orders of magnitude of improvement in efficiency.

And perhaps merely shoehorning another byte or two into v4, say v4.1 would be easier and more quickly accepted by the world. Possibly I m not strongly arguing for either, besides the fact that v6 didn t solve any problems I was having besides the world running out of addresses. It s a lot harder to grok at a glance though.

High voltage DC to a first approximation doesn t suffer from inductive losses however, which makes it much more efficient when near conductive stuff like the ground or seawater.

Knowing nothing of the area, he borrowed a New Mexico guide book.

With 2 cores you can increase the slice to 2 ms and still maintain the same number of switches per second for the system, but reducing the switches per second on each core to 500.

It was for many reasons, but primarily because the asymptomatic rate was very, very high, that there was no way to actually trace anything. Where or who you got Covid from was pure speculation for a majority of positive cases. Scales and rates matter. With TB you have a very high fidelity, testable, slow spreading causal chain. Which is why TB tracing programs are effective, and good public health policy. Our national Covid policies were ineffective, to say the least.",36656918,1688936829,2023-07-09 21:07:09,119

I believe that free press leads to the strongest economic powerhouses. You get the best of a population when you allow them all to contribute to it. Giving a bigger mouthpiece to a few people via authoritarian propaganda machines only sows discontent. Sooner or later, that discontent grows up, and rather than becoming productive, creative members of society, those people are imprisoned.

Its origin lies in 1990s C compilers, which were extremely inefficient when dispatching exceptions, leading programmers, as a pragmatic measure, to use error codes for expected errors and exceptions only for cases thought to occur infrequently. We ve long since past the time that we have to worry about such concerns. Exceptions for exceptional errors just means that you have to write code that both cares about exception safety and propagates error codes from subroutines. It s the worst of both worlds.

A case in point is our company switched from using Cassandra JVM based to ScyllaDB a C clone of Cassandra . Query latencies were the same if not faster, and we needed fewer nodes to handle the same load. All because the language used has some mechanical sympathy for the CPU it s going to run on, and no GC.

Describe the set of data you want from other sets of data and have the engine work it out. It s set theory. In math, sets can have conditions, can be combined, can be filtered, and all without a single function or loop in sight. Ergo declarative, not functional or imperative.

Hence this very article. However, note, that this isn t about in-out samples or about the preservation of the data distribution. It is about the relevant variables for deciding Y not being present in X. Statisticians, in practice, are able to better overcome these issues by simulating relevant variables and, eg., performing a bayesian analysis. Machine Learning systems have no theoretical basis to automatically build the environmental models to complete X . It is much more radical problem. Statistical model building cannot be automated.

28564160,dijit,"There is a Swedish.. uh... Tradition ? in Stockholm called Vaska 0 - basically the point is to buy a really expensive bottle of alcohol and pour it out. Why? Status. It s pretty universally reviled by the rest of Sweden but people do it. The same is true of Apple devices, some people buy the latest one every year but much like consumers of alcohol, the people who buy the yearly phones are in the small minority, just like the people who Vaska , and both are similarly reviled by the other consumers of those products. 0 define.php?term Vaska",28563455,1631878367,2021-09-17 11:32:47,100
26962436,NovemberWhiskey,"We have a criminal justice system so that, when the standard of proof can be met, the state can punish and deter wrongdoers through fines, forcible incarceration and other limitations on freedom. No-one is entitled to maintain a positive reputation just because they ve yet to be convicted in a criminal court. One can be a creepy sex-pest without that behavior rising the level of criminality, and one should not be surprised if rumors of such behavior get around. For those who feel they are being slandered, there is a law of defamation and a civil courts system for a reason. At least there, the burden of proof is only balance of probabilities.",26961815,1619561424,2021-04-27 22:10:24,113
28822708,dillondoyle,"That story is wild! First this leaker simply mailed a packet to a random foreign government address which allowed usps to flag it?! Otherwise seems pretty shot in the dark they found it. 1234 Russia KGB, Russia Second the FBI either got the cooperation of said unknown country, or was able to somehow make a signal looking like it originated from their embassy maybe as comical as we ll fly our countries flag, which happens to always be flying . Maybe it s an ally? Third this person had a good amount of access? It sounds like schematics info on the small nuclear reactors in the subs? Maybe that s not super valuable info? So much I want to know! Would make a good dramedy someday if it s as dumb as it sounds.",28822388,1633906482,2021-10-10 22:54:42,134
16089120,nerfhammer,"Dense cities are the one weird trick to human civilization itself. China has seen unbelievably explosive growth in its cities and has also seen 1 billion people lifted out of poverty during exactly the same time period. Coincidence? People flock to cities because they can get paid five times more than they could back in their home village they re not cavorting, scheming millionaires. Trying to strangle your cities because cities are bad is the dumbest thing you could do in terms of economic growth other than than trying to strangle trade on the theory that those scheming foreigners are going to take all of our money away. I m sure downtown Shenzen is more expensive today than it was when it was a small fishing village. Would the world be a better place if it had been kept as a small fishing village?",16088867,1515298724,2018-01-07 04:18:44,144
28476057,jokethrowaway,"Given they need to hire agents to decipher their returns it probably means they re using legal loopholes and hiding the money outside of the US with complicated structures. Sure, they could start saying those loopholes are not good enough but then the political system would have a 600bn pressure to implement different loopholes or risk losing all of the tax revenue with people moving somewhere else. These days the USA main advantage is offering highly paid jobs and venture capital - and the ultra rich definitely don t need that. If they re still in the States and pay little tax, they most likely own the system.",28475915,1631230940,2021-09-09 23:42:20,108
41024350,socksy,"Cars are big, and during rush hour have an average of roughly one person in them. Cities are confined spaces with lots of people living in them. As such, you are condemned to have traffic jams when cars are the main form of transport. To make car infrastructure sufficient you are required to make roads wider, which reduces the quality of life of those living in the city, and perversely increases the demand for car transport eventually leading to more traffic jams. Bikes, even in high traffic situations, move faster than cars that are stationary. And yes, cars are very safe but only for those inside of them. As they get bigger, heavier and with taller bumpers they get more and more deadly for pedestrians and cyclists.",41017046,1721561795,2024-07-21 11:36:35,127
14523377,gh02t,"It s overly complex for what I do, which is mostly hobby stuff with some occasional custom designs for my work use academic research lab, mostly custom mounts and brackets for obscure equipment . Also the onerous licensing and price. Admittedly it s been a while since I used it, so maybe the UI is more friendly nowadays but I never really found it to be particularly intuitive. But the biggest reason is I m a Linux guy and I want something I can run without rebooting into Windows or a VM. I m usually extremely wary of complex applications running in a browser, but I have to say OnShape works great and performs well.

23699098,nostrademons,"The comment was actually making a point more insulting than you assumed they re saying that AWD may or may not make cars safer, but any effect it has is dwarfed by making the owners of those cars into overconfident morons. It s a statement about drivers , not about cars. Note that your statement could be taken as either confirmation or refutation of the OP s point, entirely depending upon whether the reader believes you re an unreliable narrator. Not knowing you nor having driven an AWD car, I m not qualified to guess which is true. But as someone who s super interested in the distinction between reality and perceptions of reality, I thought the juxtaposition was pretty intriguing.",23693702,1593591089,2020-07-01 08:11:29,121
