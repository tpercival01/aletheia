For maximum power transfer, you want the load to equal the resistance of the wire. Thus you could deliver 0.072A into a 678ohm load - i.e. your maximum power would be 3.5 Watts.

Sometimes they even are willing to pay more to acquire a customer than the direct lifetime value of that customer, if the goal is to build up critical mass to break into a network-effects-heavy market.

It was on full display this week when he wrote that Neuralink had succeeded in implanting an electrode into a human brain for the first time. Similar implants have been a staple of science labs for years. At least three rival start-ups have succeeded in inserting electrodes and using them to collect and interpret human brain signals. But, while Musk s claims bring a shrug of resignation from rivals, they also draw grudging acknowledgment that his attention grabbing has helped to propel the field. Are they Neuralink ahead?

If a job is repeatedly failing you can transactionally remove it from the main queue and add it to a dead letter queue. Totally. This also leads to other operational tricks that you hope you never need, but are great the day you do. For example, a bad deploy queues a bunch of jobs with invalid arguments which will never succeed. You can open a transaction and go in and fix them in bulk using an UPDATE with jsonb select and manipulation operators. You can then even issue a SELECT to make sure that things look right before running COMMIT .

25143191,wwarner,"Her frustration with the priorities of theoretical physics probably is justified, but in this case I disagree with skdh. Her claim is that any solution for the BHIP cannot be falsified, and that strikes me as too pessimistic for two reasons. First, look at the results of pushing the theory harder with respect to spinning black holes. Many predictions of Kerr s theory have been observed, even if the ring singularity at the center hasn t. Second, we re observing new black hole phenomena every day, and if black holes really do explode at the end of evaporation, then maybe that is also observable. Sure, Hawking radiation is normally too small to be directly observed, but the theory can be driven into a place where it can make a testable prediction.",25140588,1605737695,2020-11-18 22:14:55,131

You could be absent from work for a whole day before automatically losing your job, apartment, commodity tickets, and meal tickets, and facing starvation. It wasn t until 1938 that being 20 minutes late became an automatic firing event, too. Of course, missing your quota could already bring a treason charge.

Without this short song, Waters would have gotten 3 4 of the songwriting royalties. By including it and splitting it in half, he got 5 6. Was it a purely artistic choice?

Then write a comment describing the input and output of a function, write the function header, use the form of the data structures defined above to sketch a function body with comments and a few bits of code repeat for each operation. 4.

Publish or perish means that people put up with technical debt just to get to the next result for the next paper, then do it again and again.

It s tacked onto theoretical work projects as an afterthought and not treated as what it really is forcing the theory to be tested in a computational environment.

3667095,condiment,"What's interesting about Twitter's model is that no data actually comes down to the user when they first request a tweet. Twitter builds the page, loads the layout, and initializes the client-side script, which makes a JSON request to pull an individual tweet after everything has loaded. This means that to get the requested information on first load, the user has to wait for a 2MB download, followed by another roundtrip Ajax request to twitters tweet retrieval API. This results in the perception of a slow page load, even though the tweet itself comes down the pipe in only 100ms. In my view, Twitter is an excellent case study in some of the pitfalls of thick-client application design. Mainly that ignoring the first-time-use case will result in widespread perception among users that your app is slow, even when every page view after the first is lightning fast.",3666899,1330965702,2012-03-05 16:41:42,147

These are evolutionary advantages and disadvantages to both strategies. In a highly stressed environment individuals who are less dependent on parental protection will be more likely to survive. The advantage of long childhoods and high parental involvement is that the individual will evolve sophisticated behaviors. To simply assume everyone is exactly the same at birth and modified by society to an outcome is a vast simplification that requires substantial scientific justification, you cannot just assume it given the variations of parenting we see in nature.",40055518,1713292807,2024-04-16 18:40:07,110

One of the problems with over thinking things and figuring out all the potential problems is that when presenting the ideas concepts solutions one doesn t leave enough room for response by the target audience. You end up with responses like well - you re really smart - you seem to have thought of everything . Often we really do want and need the audience to have a chance to respond, poke holes, describe what they find to be useful not useful.",18459389,1542305647,2018-11-15 18:14:07,124
43222132,YZF,I obviously did not mean dependent in the sense of can t survive without it. The energy prices in the US reflect the low price energy products they buy from Canada. It s ridiculous and false to say that in general Canada has a protectionist policy. There are some areas like maybe milk and maple where Canada is protecting its local producers but in general Canada is pro free trade. Most of the the trade skirmishes between the countries were around things like soft woods where IMO it was the Americans who were violating the trade agreements. The insinuation that Canada is somehow taking advantage of the US in trade is just nonsense. The trade imbalance is a reflection of the slower growing Canadian economy because obviously we are taking advantage of the Americans and the energy resources we sell to the US too cheaply .,43218719,1740854047,2025-03-01 18:34:07,146

To clarify again, I do not at all mean that pictograms are useless. Emojis are very useful in conveying emotions. Adding them as bullet points is decoration. I like Emojis in conversations and instant messages. I suggest reading long forms of text with emojis, I think they re an impedence.

Bazel is about opinionated builds - declare everything, and you get fast correct builds. Hard to adopt, but super powerful.

This delivers quick wins, but comes with real costs as well notably no caching labour-intensive magic to guess an initial seed of deps, with a performance cliff when something changes .

When I converted an Ocaml program to SML, I discovered that a small portion written in C ran much faster when I rewrote it in SML. In Ocaml, writing portions in C is almost always a performance win, just because the Ocaml compiler doesn t optimize very well. In MLton there s a bit of overhead just for the FFI possibly because the code generator allocates registers very differently from how it s done in C . That overhead goes away if you use the C code generator instead, but usually the native code generator performs better anyway. If I remember correctly, it has been proposed to rewrite the MLton floating point conversion in pure SML for precisely this reason.",9540852,1431615241,2015-05-14 14:54:01,139

This is useful from a conceptual perspective, and also for performance Many automatic optimizations that deductive database systems perform apply equally to facts and rules. For instance, argument indexing is a notable feature of virtually all Prolog systems.

Medical providers have an incredible informational advantage so patients just do whatever their doctor tells them. Since doctors get paid for doing things they routinely tell people to do things that are proven to have little efficacy. Medical providers should instead be paid per patient they cover. Especially now that hospitals are so consolidated it s relatively easy to tell if health outcomes are better or worse than average over the group of patients they cover. By punishing providers for achieving bad outcomes and sharing the savings they obtain by cutting waste we can drastically reduce healthcare costs.

As mentioned in our paper, other distributed SQL databases also utilize the YCSB benchmark. You might be interested in the YugabyteDB vs. CockroachDB comparison we referenced. 3. Distributed databases are complex, comprising multiple layers. Though a key-value load is relatively simple to comprehend, it still allows for the performance evaluation of various layers like the transport layer, GRPC, underlying storage, and so forth.

Theoretical analysis shows that XOR-Net reduces one-third of the bit-wise operations compared with traditional binary convolution, and up to 40 of the full- precision operations compared with XNOR-Net. Experimental results show that our XOR-Net binary convolution without scaling factors achieves up to 135 speedup and consumes no more than 0.8 energy compared with parallel full-precision convolution. The big question is whether or not the results are still as good.

I'm sure there would be correlation, but I suspect that it would be very far from perfect, possibly because of talent or inadvertently or deliberately discovering better and more effective ways to practice. I'm reminded me of when I was a kid and played chess with a friend a lot. At first I could beat him and we played about the same amount but suddenly he inexplicably got far better than me. It bugged the hell out of me So I think the result of Adams' lesson would actually be to teach people that they have strengths and weaknesses, and practice helps a lot, but it will rather quickly get swamped by talent in any realistic endeavor. And results might also be strongly affected by effective coaching or acquiring specific knowledge to make those hours of practice dramatically more effective.",1647377,1283261248,2010-08-31 13:27:28,150

They are basically just specialized cameras with bright flash lights. I wonder if prices have come down a bit and if there are good options out there for such a portable microscope that doesn t break so quickly.

Furthermore, even companies that are technology-based will still struggle if they don't see themselves as a technology company. For example -- as PG has written -- Yahoo saw itself as a media company rather than a technology company. Contrast this with Google. From first-hand experience, I've seen how eBay is managed as a retail brand, rather than a technology company and relied for years on acquisitions over home-grown tech . Contrast this with Amazon.

Maybe 1 0 inf is reasonable, but would you agree that there s no reasonable answer for 0 0? So IMO, reasonable languages must define division as a partial function, or a function that can throw an error or return NaN, Nothing, etc .

I don t know that this is solid reasoning. Certainly there is some limit eventually imposed by soil nutrient content but there could also be other reasons plants don t grow large fruit. A big one being that plants which grow their fruit to spread seeds reach efficiency when there is enough fruit to attract a spreading organism and no more. In fact, basically all the plants we consume were already unusually large even before the green revolution. Humans had selected or hybridized the popular cultivars to an extreme already.

To rephrase the question - do you think that these experiences are convergent, in that anyone with enough discipline to meditate for long enough will have them, or do you think that these experiences are the result of Goenka s guidance? To further the question, are you saying that the counterintuitive claims are something at which again given enough practice discipline we all would arrive, or just that we would all share something similar to the experiences that they were born from?",5959093,1372440102,2013-06-28 17:21:42,135

This team has concluded that the safest and most practical way to target Apple s platform is using one of Apple s compilers in this case, clang . I m not sure if I agree with that conclusion. After all, RubyMotion and the Elements Compiler have kept up with all the new compiler requirements from Apple, including the requirement to emit bitcode for watchOS and tvOS. So clearly it s possible. And using LLVM directly, rather than using C as an intermediate representation, yields more control over debug information.

However, as a sibling comment notes, Linux has also preserved binary compatibility at the kernel level for a similar amount of time of course as long as neither of them break compatibility then Windows will have the numerical edge as it s slightly older . So the question becomes, why is compatibility so apparently good on Windows and so apparently bad on Linux? I feel it s to do with a culture of dynamic linking and compiling your own software. A statically linked X11 application from 15 years ago will, as far as I can tell, run fine on Linux - it s just that such things are rare. You re far more likely to come across either a dynamically linked binary, or a source tree.

So if a company got a profit hike, reinvested all of it, then had a deflation shock, they might go bankrupt.

My idea - I welcome counter arguments - is to calculate the district s center of mass and find the furthest point the district still contains from that center of mass. Then create a circle with that distance as the radius and find the percentage of _land_ maybe even privately owned land? within that circle that is in the district. My view is that the percentage should be something like 50 maybe higher? Hard to say without actually designing districts and checking the numbers . 50 would mean that half of the habitable land remaining in the circle could be a different district but no more. 1 en.wikipedia.org wiki Coastline_paradox,24479530,1600304031,2020-09-17 00:53:51,143

It does require much more code than mmap -ing and fairly sophisticated code at that. If you are doing it well, 3-5x throughput improvement seems to be average upside in my experience, which is huge. The scheduler behind mmap simply does not have enough context about the workload to make good paging decisions leading to a lot of suboptimal or wasted I O, and this is magnified when the storage I O is under pressure.

If battery tech or other energy storage takes longer than expected to come up to speed, we ll still be reliant on fossil fuels for baseload capacity.

Instead, students add modify code within an overall framework.

Meaning that it takes more like 5 minutes to actually fill my car from empty. Also, there s the good enough argument - 5 minutes gets you to the point where there s no perceivable difference. 5 minute charging would be a game changer. That means urban dwellers could use EVs the same as gas engine cars and that road trips look exactly the same as they do now presumably gas stations would add EV stations with enough market penetration . This cable isn t the big issue in making that happen, but it s needed.

Decisions that you can have an explanation for and defend. In a work context, D3.js is overkill most of the time. People expect line charts, maps, bubble charts that are simple and interactive...doing that in d3.js is a lot of copy paste from examples and spending days to weeks working on simple details that would come OOTB in something like Highcharts. I would only recommend d3.js if you really want to dive deep into the constructs of the visualization.

As such, it s been quite a while since the current state of AOSP is at the same level as Google s internal builds, leaving developers and others to wait on Google to make a public release to get all of the new changes. With this change to move everything to its internal, private development branch, Google isn t changing the speed at which these new builds arrive. Rather, this will potentially streamline the process and prevent conflicts when merging the branch",43485832,1743114889,2025-03-27 22:34:49,145

If lightning was standard, we would probably see a lot more failures, simply because not everyone has the same quality requirements as Apple.

Generally it does it by parsing the elf headers, resolving all the symbols recursively, and calling mmap to properly allocate memory for the program as well as to mmap the program text and libraries into memory.

In every case, it results in devaluation, then exploitation, then burnout of previously enthusiastic, talented developers who soon leave.

I ve wrestled for many hours trying to get them to write me a short, simple function in a non-popular language and they failed again and again. I also suspect these LLMs are going to have huge problems when APIs and language definitions change, because the data they re trained on usually doesn t have API language version metadata attached to it, so they have no way of knowing which version is applicable to whatever you re trying to do. They may spit out code in an obsolete API version, for example, or even give you code containing mixed API versions. This will be a nightmare to debug.",36019109,1684671816,2023-05-21 12:23:36,133

Also, at least some of that research hypothesized that the relationship was due to calcium-related suppression of vitamin D metabolism...which would beg the original question. I think that if the researchers behind this study were to do an equivalent study for men, they'd reduce the calcium levels to the US RDA for whatever cohort they chose.",752150,1249938836,2009-08-10 21:13:56,114

As human population grows, we might fly more, from the extreme of a fewer people flying a lot, to many people with the means to fly sometimes. I m not rooting for zero flights, just a population-independent limit on fuel burned to move us and our stuff around, in the interest of a healthier ecosystem. At an individual-responsibility level, consider flying less. At a collective government level, consider regulation to help people make such sacrifices, and have it be transparently fair enough to limit exploitation.

Not sure how scheduling overhead would compare between charmpy and multiprocessing, but for this task it shouldn t matter I assume you need at least a second to convert one file, and even if the conversion is faster, you can chunk the tasks anyway to mask overhead . I would say the big difference for this task is if you want to run it in parallel on multiple hosts, which pool.map can t do. With charmpy we can provide a distributed parallel map offering the same or similar API as pool.map.

I also know there are several tools which let you do this to varying degrees of success with LaTeX as an output. My own preference is having a complete understanding of why everything is where it is in a layout.

22481496,ncmncm,"There are usually very sound reasons not to release memory back to the OS, particularly in a multithreaded program. Each such release causes a TLB shootdown , in which threads on other cores are blocked while the cores translation lookaside buffers , caches of page mappings, are cleared, and further stalls as their entries are re-filled. This is another reason to prefer single-threaded processes, which are less subject to such shootdowns, and less-coupled forms of parallelism. Besides the TLB potholes, releasing memory means that the next time memory is requested, the OS is obliged to zero it before the process gets to see it again. Furthermore, each page will be marked read-only, causing a trap the first time it is touched, and then zeroed lazily. As a result, freeing memory to the OS should only be essayed with the support of a great deal of measurement of the consequences.",22478675,1583300976,2020-03-04 05:49:36,149

The idea is that if it were ever seized then it would have to be read as evidence in the court.

Interestingly, in the small number of cultures where it does exist, the men are always brothers -- presumably this is the only way to get the situation to work without the men killing each other and or children which they suspect to not be theirs. I haven't read Sex At Dawn, but human mating really has very little in common with bonobo mating.

The result was Display PostScript, or DPS. DPS added basic functionality to improve performance by changing many string lookups into 32 bit integers, adding support for direct output with every command, and adding functions to allow the GUI to inspect the diagram. Additionally, a set of bindings was provided to allow PS code to be called directly from the C programming language. NeXT used these bindings in their NeXTStep system to provide an object oriented graphics system. Although DPS was written in conjunction with NeXT, Adobe sold it commercially and it was a common feature of most Unix workstations in the 1990s. en.wikipedia.org wiki PostScript History",11340516,1458688233,2016-03-22 23:10:33,143
